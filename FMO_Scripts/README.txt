The FMO-script folder contains the script that allows for modification of the input file generated by FACIO.

The script uses GAMESS .inp file as the input.

It has the following functionality.

1) Print out the charge of each fragment in separate file and create array of scftyp and mult 
that are based on the charges of individual fragments.

2) Numerate fragments with positive, negative and zero charges. Could be modified 
to print out fragments with the specific charges.

3) Print out the separate indat files (list of atoms in each fragment) for positive, negative and zero-charged fragments.

In addition to main script the FMO-script folder contains the "clean" script that removes all output files.
Finally, the FMO_Script_Output subfolder contains the output example.
